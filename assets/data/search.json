    "content"  : "What is Zeta project aboutWhat we are designing in Zeta project is a common Networking Service Gateway (NSG for short) inCloud and Data Center virtual networking environment.  To existing virtual networking infrastructure, Zeta NSG serves as a common proxy for offloadedor additional virtual networking functions (VNF for short) in the form of XDP programs  To those VNFs, Zeta NSG serves as a common hosting platform and framework to integrate theminto the overall virtual networking environment  Zeta NSG offers performance, scalability and fault-tolerance for both Gateway service itself andthe VNFs it hosts  Depends on capability and availability of hosted networking functions, Zeta NSG service extendsfrom most basic “Encapsulation proxy” all the way up to complete End-to-End networking service chain.  Zeta NSG can operate in a standalone mode or extends its framework to Compute nodes for some or all its VNFs, in a distributed fashionWhat values Zeta project brings inCompares to traditional central hosted virtual networking solutions, Zeta NSG solution offers:  NSG clustering for scalability and reliability  Unique Transparent Cluster Scaling to the NSG clients  XDP/eBPF based VNF for maximal performance and minimal forwarding overheadCompares to distributed virtual networking solutions, Zeta NSG solution offers:  Support large compute node mesh, scaling up to tens of thousands  Achieves same even better performance and latency characteristics  XDP/eBPF based VNF for maximal performance and minimal forwarding overheadAre you interested, come check it out!Zeta System Design"

    "content"  : "Fugaku is the new KingThe biggest GOOD news in IT industry this year must be the announcement of Fugaku supercomputer in earlier June, taking the top spot on the Top500 list, a ranking of the world’s fastest supercomputers. It also swept the other rankings of supercomputer performance, taking first place on the HPCG, a ranking of supercomputers running real-world applications, HPL-AI, which ranks supercomputers based on their performance capabilities for tasks typically used in artificial intelligence applications, and Graph 500, which ranks systems based on data-intensive loads. This is the first time in history that the same supercomputer has become No.1 on Top500, HPCG, and Graph500 simultaneously.Why am I so excited about Fugaku and use this news as my opening post for a new HPC series?The concept of Fugaku is proposed 10 years ago and the project started around 2014. Its concept is not brand new but significant design and packaging improvements are applied over its predecessors. These changes and improvements reflected some of most heated debate/discussions in HPC industry and can serve very well as testimony in these topics.A few key differentiation factors of interest are:  ARM v8 SVE instruction set vs Fujitsu’s traditional SPARC solution vs Intel x86  48 low Freq/low power cores per CPU vs less core with higher Freq/power per CPU  HBM vs DDR4/GDDR6  6D Mesh/Torus interconnect topology vs Blue Gene’s 5D Torus vs Summit’s Fat-Tree  3D stacked memory vs integrated memory on chipWhy am I even interested about HPC/Supercomputer, as a networking (in macro way) guy?  Supercomputer/HPC is technology driver for computing industry, especially in packaging and interconnect.  Converged compute, storage and interconnect co-design is deep in its gene for supercomputer/HPC  Boundary between HPC and non-HPC applications has blurred in recent years, especially with AI and IoT applications, making HPC solutions very relevant to general purpose compute infrastructure like DC and edge.In the following posts in this series, I will dig deeper into above areas and reflect the knowledge into the more generic NCS discussions, stay tuned friends!"

    "content"  : "  “To be, or not to be? That is the question”   ― William Shakespeare, HamletReflection on Data FidelityIs data communication or more specific, computer networking, science or art?Is the world analog or digital?Ever since computer started taking charge of our life, everything started the transformation of digitization, sooner or later. It makes everything easier to quantify, measure, compute and transport and is truly the foundation for the information revolution.Many years of engineering training and over 20 years of professional practice in data communication industry, it has become my second nature to think and view things in 0s and 1s, black or white, right or wrong. Everything becomes easier and manageable this way and you can really feel the power to change the world. As we immersing deeper and deeper into this digital world we help created, I realized one day that something is not right, I started to get confused about the truth vs lie, fact vs fiction, and more importantly, purpose vs meaning.Rethinking what is the purpose of data communication, is it really just sending data from A to B accurately, efficiently and in an timely manner?I would say that’s mostly (will elaborate more later) true among digital computers, but surely not totally true for human beings.For human beings, digitalization is never by nature. Our brains doesn’t work like digital computer and our perception system is NOT in binary. Our sensing system works continuously within its functional spectrum, our intelligence system takes infinite inputs and everyone evolves into unique beautiful beings. One of my hobby is working on my HiFi system and one of lessons I learnt from it is that digital processing and amplification does create lots of fun and flexibility, it NEVER sounds as nature as an analog system. 0s and 1s does reduces ambiguity within the player/receiver/amp but it’s not the fidelity we human being want as listener. From this example, clearly we can see the digital data communication system we use today has three fundamental functions:  A/D and D/A transformation at input and output to inject the digital system into a naturally analog world  Digital processing, such as encapsulation, multiplexing, encoding etc  Recording or transportationTraditionally, data communication industry focuses on function 2 and 3 above and leaves function 1 to human-machine interface devices like computer and mobile devices. Taking the HiFi case as an example, function 1 decides the fidelity of music we hear out of the system no matter how well we do in function 2 and 3. As a matter of fact, regarding to fidelity, the best we can do in function 2 and 3 is to reduce the degradation to ZERO. Yeah, that is pathetic but it’s exactly the problem we have in this industry. For too long we have buried our head in sand building pipes, eventually we lost our sight for the purpose of communication. We struggle on pushing towards Shannon’s Theorem limit, building more and more, fatter and fatter data pipes, from deep sea to outer space but still, we see no future to meet the mounting demands.It’s time to drop the wrench and rethink hard on the purpose for communication, which fidelity we should be focusing on now. Here are a few questions worth asking ourselves:  Garbage in, garbage out - should we care A LOT on what to communicate, aka the input, in stead of just making sure transport “garbages” in high fidelity?  Do we communicate the **RIGHT” information, no more and no less, over the communication system? Instead of trying to beat the Shannon limit, shouldn’t we change the battle field rethinking what should be the “Information” we feed into the pipes as a better approach?  Can we make the RIGHT communication choice when communication system is peripheralized from the rest of information processing systems, namely compute and storage?Think of an interactive Holographic Telepresence scheme, which transports only 100s Mbps meta data in stead of 100-1000s Gbps encoded 3D data, that is 3-4 orders of magnitude reduction in both bandwidth and latency demand to the communication system, making it a much achievable goal.This is a challenging time for networking, but it’s also a perfect time for breaking away: Welcome to an era of converged compute, storage and networking, friend!"

    "content"  : "Reflection on Network IntelligenceRemember in my early days in networking industry, Cisco used to fight against Microsoft regarding where the network intelligence should be implemented. Microsoft at the time dominated the PC market and was pushing network features at end-point such as security, acceleration, QoS etc. Network vendors led by Cisco on the other hand wanted to weave most if not all network intelligence into network itself. As we know up till now, similar fights have never ended, just with player and battle fields changes. Unfortunately, this left us some confusing products and terms we still have to deal with up till now, such as UTM devices in the network but truly not a networking device, and over-kill TCP/IP stack deployed among end-points to accommodate worst network scenario where they are actually communicate in a close proximity LAN environment.Arguments from either sides are valid to certain extent and I’m not making any judgement here. It just suddenly stuck me when I trying to solve a networking issue seemingly unsolvable with conflicting constrains. That is the starting point of my long journey of rethinking some of the basics in the networking industry. For such a long time we have isolate networking from other information technologies such as compute, storage. We define some protocols and implement some network infrastructures based on very OLD assumptions that we networking guys are only responsible to deliver data from A to B fast, reliable and effectively. The additional intelligence we want to baked into network are also for above purposes as well, such as TCP offload, in-network retransmit etc. We never question why we need to do that and unfortunately this holds true for other parts as well.About 9 years ago I started moving my knowledge stack up from embedded network design into software defined networking (SDN), Intent Based Networking (IBN) and then networked applications. The higher I goes up the stack, the bigger the scope I can see, both problems and solutions, from interface to network element, to site, to multi-site, to global. During the transition, I learnt that something used to be so important even critical at local becomes irrelevant when looked at from a much bigger picture, such as pursuing zero drop rate at interface level, which has very little impact to application, our ultimate goal.Along this line of thinking, I would argue that even if all parts are optimal, the combination may not be optimal. Why? It’s also strongly depends on how we partitioned the original problem, in other words, how parts are divided and their responsibility defined. We know know we need to optimize networking End-to-End to satisfy application needs rather than focus on some intermediate segment. What we also need to know is that there is NO fixed boundary among compute, storage and networking within an application. As I mentioned in the 1st post in NCS-Reflection series, rather than shipping data between compute and storage or between compute units, compute instructions can be shipped or triggered remotely instead under certain circumstance, totally changes the request and requirement for networking part.To summarize, I think we should not talk about intelligence or optimization in an isolate matter, either just a network segment or network as a whole alone. Intelligence and optimization all must serve the benefit of application hence must be considered as a whole at application level before dividing into networking or computing portions. There is no need for network to exist if it doesn’t serve the compute and storage, on the other hand, if compute and storage treat networking part of interconnection, like ALU to Registers, CPU Core to memory and I/O systems, the world will just like a super big computer, with interconnection among compute nodes and storage nodes. If applications within a computer can be made agnostic (largely) to computer configuration, we sure can make them fly in this globally abstracted supper computer.This is a challenging time for networking, but it’s also a perfect time for breaking away: Welcome to an era of converged compute, storage and networking, friend!"

    "content"  : "Reflection on OSI modelIn the world of inter-networking, the most popular standard has to be TCP/IP protocol, which forms the basis of the Internet connecting billions of computers and devices around the world. It’s so popular and vital to our daily life now a days that it’s used even when communication is local across compatible networks. For example, popular network file system NFS uses IP protocol even though it’s used mainly in homogenous ethernet LAN environment.The software standards like TCP/IP allowing reliable communication without demanding reliable networks is the key enabling technologies for inter-networking. Looking back the standard battle with ATM in 1990s, one key success factor is it’s decomposed layered hierarchy. Each layer taking responsibility for just a portion of the overall communication task. To avoid ambiguous in terms, Open System Interconnect (OSI) model is developed which describes networks as a series of layers:            Layer number      layer name      Main function      Example protocol                  7      Application      Application running over network      DNS, Web              6      Presentation      Translate between Application and network format                     5      Session      Session lifecycle management across network      RPC,named pipes              4      Transport      Additional connection below session layer      TCP              3      Network      Translate between logic address/name to physical address      IP              2      Data Link      Transform between packet and bits      Ethernet              1      Physical      TX/RX bit stream over physical media      IEEE 802      The key to protocol families following OSI model is that communication occurs logically at same level of the protocol between sender and receiver, while services from lower level implement it. Just like abstract data types which simplifies the programmer’s task by hiding the implementation details of the data type, offering services needed by upper layer at each protocol layer makes the standard easier to understand and implement with cross industry compatibility, especially for lower level protocol vendors.For 20 years since mid 1990s, Internet has enjoyed exponential growth thanks to the dominant position of TCP/IP. Network vendors like Cisco took lead and protocols are added and expanded with a bottom up approach to protect the investment in lower level infrastructures. It is until recent years we see some challenges and movements against long-standing TCP/IP stack and traditional network infrastructures (both topology and component levels), driven by OTT providers’ performance, scalability and fault tolerance demands.The analysis for the huge success of AWS, Azure, GCP and Ali cloud in the past 5-10 years deserves a dedicate study series but here is one important factor from technology point of view: they just need purposely built network for their intent business need, so they built proprietary homogeneous network infrastructure from scratch with optimized and simplified protocol stack, achieving cost, power consumption and networking efficiency.It is on the right track but start to show limitations facing challenges from:  Data volume and dispersal driven by AI and IoT  Dynamic business logic driven by tenant IT migrationSimply put, the “simplification” approach OTT providers have enjoyed for their past success is just not enough when facing these new challenges, which demands REAL application driven design, with Top Down principle.Back to OSI model, we have to abandon the assumption of TCP/IP, Ethernet, etc and go back to basic:  Layers are for separation of responsibilities in a hierarchical way  Upper layer should not aware or concern about lower layer  Lower layer is responsible of fulfilling or rejecting the requests from upper layerWhich means, instead of the bottom-up approach where upper layer operates based on what lower level offers, upper layer operates purely based on its own need and send only intent to lower layer, where lower layer has the flexibility to choose available and viable technology to fulfill or reject the request.Think of a future where we can have harmonized heterogeneous network clusters (devices, topologies or protocols) within data centers and extend into edge, campus even SoC, tailored for different compute-storage usage, totally transparent to applications layer; Think of a laptop where all bandwidth of wired and available WiFi band can be utilized simultaneously; Think of google-search-like information query from application; Think of instructions rather than data been networked to fulfill the request using remote data, etc.This is a challenging time for networking, but it’s also a perfect time for breaking away: Welcome to an era of converged compute, storage and networking, friend!"

There is NO real differences between category and tag, I choose some as categories merely to group contents by my major areas of interest first.I split Tags into 4 dimensions:  To what extent:          Insight focus on Obervation, facts and impression      Forsight focus on deepening and broadening the analysis, forming opinion, prediction and design      Practice forcus on test, evalution and discovery        From which angle/perspective:          Market focus on market trend, customer demand      Industry focus on industry trend, solutions      Technology focus on fundamental acdamic research        Applicable to what sub-area:          Infrastructure      Solution      Application      Usecase        Keywords (Multiple)          Jekyll      Liquid      DCN      DCI      Edge      Campus      etc      As you can see tags within dimensions 1-3 are mutually exclusive by nature, so they are more like sub-categories.

Then, create an HTML element wherever you want your table of contents to appear:&amp;lt;div id=&quot;toc&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;Then you put your post with titles and all like:## Title## Mid title 1This is text on page one## Mid title 2This is text for page two### Sub title 2.aSome more textThen at the end of your post, you call the .toc() function using:&amp;lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&amp;gt;$(document).ready(function() {    $(&#39;#toc&#39;).toc();});&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;How it would look like"
